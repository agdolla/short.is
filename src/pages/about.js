          <PostIntro>
            I&rsquo;m Alan Shortisâ€”a front end developer based in Nottingham. I like CSS more than
            JavaScript, aesthetics more than data, design systems more than chaos, and accessibility
            more than exclusion.

            <h2>Experience and Skills</h2>
            <p>
              As a front end developer, I specialise in developing user interfaces in HTML and CSS.
              But, it being {thisYear}, I also work extensively in JavaScript, using React/Node and
              friends on a daily basis.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have been a developer profressionally in some capacity for more than 10 years,
              though I made my first websites in the late 90s. They were terrible, even by the
              standards of Geocities.
            </p>
            <p>
              My preference for front end development is likely connected to me being a design
              hobbyist who used the internet to show off half baked and derivative ideas. Across my
              career I have also worked with Classic ASP, PHP, WordPress and SQL in my brief time as
              an analyst.
            </p>
            <p>
              I&rsquo;m currently working for Experian, and have previously worked in higher
              education, agencies, and retail both as an individual and as part of an agile team.
            </p>
