Compiled across the year, these are my favourite tracks from the albums I liked in 2015. They're not ranked; just ordered to keep a nice flow between genres.

### Surprise

**Beak>** were not a band I had never heard of, and I'm not even sure how I stumbled upon this EP (split with <KAEB, obviously). Spacious instrumental music has always been pretty appealing to me so it's always great to find more.

### Disappointment

**The Dead Weather** really impressed me with the first couple of albums but unfortunately this time around it felt a little formulaic. It's one of those albums that just kind of you passes you by as it's playing the background, with nothing to really grab you.
