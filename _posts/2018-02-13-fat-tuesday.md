I've never been to New Orleans and admittedly I didn't know a great deal about the city, its heritage and and incredible musical diversity until the HBO show [Trem√©](https://www.hbo.com/treme) - a show that genuinely touched me every episode despite being a white, middle class man some 5,000 miles away.

Stories of people trying to rebuild their lives, homes and businesses after Katrina while still keeping tradition and culture close to their hearts. I loved it.

I had inadvertently seen and heard a good number of NOLA bands over the years, most notably Dumpstaphunk and Galactic at Bonnaroo. Dr. John is one of those musicians who I picked up on in my early teens just as I was getting into music. 

Visiting New Orleans during Mardi Gras is a bucket list item for me. But until then, I always listen to NOLA artists all day on Fat Tuesday. I hope the selection below is suitable, not too obvious and without too many omissions.

Note: Try as I might, I just can't get in to Bounce. And bands like Crowbar and Down just didn't fit my vibe today. So, here we are.
