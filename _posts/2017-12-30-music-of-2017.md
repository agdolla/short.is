Compiled across the year, these are my favourite tracks from the albums I liked in 2017. They're not ranked; just ordered to a nice flow between genres.

### Surprise

**Roger Waters**. His last solo rock album was released in [1992](https://open.spotify.com/album/5RqQH15mFgHI984n25pFg3). His last album with Pink Floyd was in [1983](https://open.spotify.com/album/5ChHkKb5VhZe0pgQRsvpek). He's been living off [The Wall](https://open.spotify.com/album/1ITpsfAcoaSe4i1tUXm44D) for a long time, and as much as I love The Wall I'd like to hear him do something that is not The Wall. 

This is not The Wall. 

This what I imagine Pink Floyd sounding like in 2017, and whether you like Roger's outspoken nature when it comes to politics or not you cannot deny that it is a strong and arguably positive influence on his music. I was always a bit more of a Gilmour man when it came to Pink Floyd, but he cannot touch Roger when it comes to concept and producing an _album_ rather than a collection of songs.


### Disappointment

**Thundercat**. [Drunk](https://open.spotify.com/album/7vHBQDqwzB7uDvoE5bncMM) has had amazing reviews all year and was ranked number one in [BBC 6 music's albums of year](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/1hmMD1cStjTcClPbqqT79j/6-music-recommends-albums-of-the-year-2017). I wanted to like it. I was really looking forward to it. But... I just don't really like it all that much.

The standout track for me was [Them Changes](https://open.spotify.com/track/7CH99b2i1TXS5P8UUyWtnM) which previously appeared on a [2015 EP](https://open.spotify.com/album/1atZ1TiIPZZec0oiyY1mBl). I love that [Isley Brothers](https://open.spotify.com/track/5cDylrPWlV0A3XbX5fRTrd) intro.
