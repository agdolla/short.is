### Disappointment

**Palms**. I loved ISIS. I like Deftones for the most part. But this collaboration just did very little for me unfortunately. I wouldn't say it's a bad album, it's just a little uneventful. It passes you by with very little to make you sit up and pay attention. The mix sounds a bit odd to my ears too. A lot of top end, less low end making the guitars sound a little impotent.
