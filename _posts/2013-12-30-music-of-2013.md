Compiled across the year, these are my favourite tracks from the albums I liked in 2013. They're not ranked; just ordered to keep a nice flow between genres.

### Surprise

**Perera Elsewhere** was an artist recommended to me by Spotify, most likely because '[Giddy](https://open.spotify.com/track/0x76c43youNds03nF2h6Mr)' features Gonjasufi. I've really enjoyed this album and been compelled to come back to it repeatedly.

### Disappointment

**Palms**. I loved ISIS and I like Deftones for the most part but this collaboration did very little for me unfortunately. It's possible that the anticipation raised my expectations to unrealistic levels, so I wouldn't say it's a bad album as such. It passes you by with very little to make you sit up and pay attention and the mix sounds a bit odd to my ears. A lot of top end with the muted low end making the guitars seem a little impotent.
