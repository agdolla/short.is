There isn't really much of a musical theme here. In fact, I think it may well be the first time [Manowar](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4CzUzn54Cp9TQr6a7JIlMZ) and [Billy Ocean](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5IDs1CK15HegSAhGEbSYXo) have appeared on the same playlist. However, every one of these tracks opens with the sound of a car starting. That's all.

Admittedly I needed a little help to find 10 tracks that specifically included a car starting and not just some miscellaneous engine noise (it's important to have standards). I managed to completely forget the intro to [Songs for the Death](https://open.spotify.com/album/4w3NeXtywU398NYW4903rY), and for some reason I have never listened to [Kraftwerk](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0dmPX6ovclgOy8WWJaFEUU) properly so it came to suggestions via twitter to include these.

I've had this knocking around in my mind for absolutely years and it was [Roxy Music](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3fhOTtm0LBJ3Ojn4hIljLo), [Primus](https://open.spotify.com/artist/64mPnRMMeudAet0E62ypkx) and [Jamiroquai](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6J7biCazzYhU3gM9j1wfid) that really got the ball rolling.
