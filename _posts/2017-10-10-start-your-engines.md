There isn't really much of a musical theme here. In fact, I think it may well be the first time [Manowar](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4CzUzn54Cp9TQr6a7JIlMZ) and [Billy Ocean](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5IDs1CK15HegSAhGEbSYXo) have appeared on the same playlist. However, every one of these tracks opens with the sound of a car starting.

This is more common than you might think, and I've had the skeleton of this playlist rattling around in my head for absolutely years. It was [Roxy Music](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3fhOTtm0LBJ3Ojn4hIljLo), [Primus](https://open.spotify.com/artist/64mPnRMMeudAet0E62ypkx) and [Jamiroquai](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6J7biCazzYhU3gM9j1wfid) that got the ball rolling.

My unwritten rule of keeping these loosely themed playlists to ten tracks almost went out the window, and I needed a little help finding songs that specifically included a car _starting_ and not just some miscellaneous engine noise (it's important to have standards). I managed to completely forget the intro to [Songs for the Deaf](https://open.spotify.com/album/4w3NeXtywU398NYW4903rY), and for some reason I have never listened to [Kraftwerk](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0dmPX6ovclgOy8WWJaFEUU) properly so it came to suggestions via twitter to make up the numbers.
