Compiled across the year, these are my favourite tracks from the albums I liked in 2014. They're not ranked; just ordered to keep a nice flow between genres.

### Surprise

**Taylor McFerrin**. This popped up in Spotify artist radio and quickly become my go-to album for pretty much everything. I would listen to nothing else for literally days at a time, finding something new to love on each rotation. '[Already There](https://open.spotify.com/track/3gvyPbItfdZP6LMPHl48Ns)' features Thundercat, and having a bit of a weakness for talented bassists I was drawn even further in. I don't like to pick favourites, but if I was forced to...

### Disappointment

I genuinely cannot choose anything. Scanning through this playlist illustrates just how good 2014 was for music (well, the particular styles of music that I like). Choosing Taylor McFerrin over Earth, GoGo Penguin, Beck, Shellac and Damien Juardo was not easy.

### Special Mention

**Flying Lotus** for the Freddie Mercury sample in '[Dead Man's Tetris](https://open.spotify.com/track/1BIbmMh56vFd0lktWfbooJ)'.
