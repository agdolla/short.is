### Surprise

**Taylor McFerrin**. This popped up in some Spotify artist radio station and quickly become my go-to album for pretty much everything. I would listen to nothing else for literally days at a time, finding something new to love on each rotation. 'Already There' features Thundercat on bass, and having a bit of a weakness for talented bassists I was drawn even further in. I don't like to pick favourites, but if I was forced to...

### Disappointment

I genuinely cannot choose anything. Scanning through this playlist illustrates really nicely just how good 2014 was for music. Well, the particular styles of music that I like. Choosing Taylor McFerrin over Earth, GoGo Penguin, Beck and Damien Juardo was not easy.

### Special Mention

**Flying Lotus** for the incredible Freddie Mercury sample in 'Dead Man's Tetris'.
