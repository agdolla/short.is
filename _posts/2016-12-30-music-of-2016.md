### Dissapointment

**The Claypool/Lennon Delirium**. To be honest, I'm not sure why I still expect good things from Les Claypool recordings. It's been almost 20 years since The Brown Album which is the last consistently great studio album (despite a glimmer of hope in the shape of Purple Onion and Oysterhead).  This album suffers from the same issues as the last few solo Claypool albums - the recording quality isn't great, and where Les/Sean have decided to handle the drums themselves, the playing isn't at the same standard as the other instruments.

You can rely on Les Claypool for something else, though. No matter how poor the studio album, the live shows that follow will be _exceptional_. I've not been able to see any of this album performed live (with Paulo Baldi behind the kit, who should be recruited for recording too) but the recordings I have seen and heard have been excellent. The album tracks take a whole new shape and some exceptional covers (King Crimson, Yes) just put the cherry on top.

### Surprise

**Childish Gambino**. The track I have picked (Have Some Love) in particular sounds like Parliment/Funkadelic at their absolute best. I love it. I almost didn't listen to this album at all.
