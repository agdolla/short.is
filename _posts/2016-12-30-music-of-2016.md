Compiled across the year, these are my favourite tracks from the albums I liked in 2016. They're not ranked; just ordered to a nice flow between genres.

### Surprise

**Childish Gambino**. The track I have picked ([Have Some Love](https://open.spotify.com/track/6TJrqqpm5eCSU9NsD8AjrR)) sounds like Parliment/Funkadelic at their absolute best. This shouldn't be too surprising considering '[Riot](https://open.spotify.com/track/12FSzk0wDNG6yZ6ldBXIAS)' contains a sample of 'Good to Your Earhole' and 'Redbone' is clearly influenced by Bootsy Collins.

### Disappointment

**The Claypool/Lennon Delirium**. I'm not sure why I still expect good things from Les Claypool recordings. It's been almost 20 years since The [Brown Album](https://open.spotify.com/album/2JNjBuZ5dQxk8bJxkhJgQQ) which is the last consistently great studio album (despite a glimmer of hope in the shape of Purple Onion and Oysterhead). This album suffers from the same issues as the last few solo Claypool albums - the recording quality isn't great, and where Les/Sean have decided to handle the drums themselves the playing doesn't match the standard of the other instruments.

You can always rely on Les Claypool for one thing though: No matter how average the studio album, the live shows that follow will be _exceptional_. I've not been able to see any of this album performed live but the [recordings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cajrnY_fGDk) are excellent, especially with King Crimson and Pink Floyd covered flawlessly.

### Special Mention

Andr√© 3000's verse (which makes up the entire track) on **Frank Ocean** - [Solo (Reprise)](https://open.spotify.com/track/0iqdHpozH9HIYfM0FIftfa) is probably the best 79 seconds of vocals all year.
